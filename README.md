# Eduardo's dotfiles

The first JavaScript-based dotfiles powered by [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

![Preview](http://f.cl.ly/items/423c1j0C0r0x1c0C033f/dotfiles.png)

## Dependencies

1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com), if you don't have it yet.
2. Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/), if you don't have it yet.

## How to install?

```sh
$ [sudo] npm install -g dotfiles
```

This will install [dotfiles](http://npmjs.org/dotfiles) from [NPM](http://npmjs.org).

## How to setup?

```sh
$ dotfiles setup
```

This will symlink the appropriate files into your home directory. It may ask your password multiple times during the process.

You could also setup things separated by running `setup:alfred`, `setup:git`, `setup:iterm`, `setup:osx`, `setup:ruby`, or `setup:zsh`.

## How to update?

```sh
$ dotfiles
```

Just type `dotfiles` and it lets you know when updates are available.
